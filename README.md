# HashBlast

Creates MD5, SHA256, SH512 hashes in hexidecimal format! Everything I did was to was done in python IDLE. Created a new file from IDLE and saved it as a .py file.

### Prerequisites
```
Things you will need:
1) Computer
2) Python 3.7, or python2
3) Python IDLE
4) Pip3 or Pip
5) hashlib

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get the program running.

```
step 1: Downlaod Python 3.7 https://www.python.org/downloads/
step 2: Open Python IDLE
step 3: Create New File
step 4: It should already have the module hashlib, but if not then type pip3 install hashlib or pip install hashlib in terminal
step 5: Import Code/Improvise the Code
step 6: Execute the Code and Type Whatever you Want Hashed!
